This is a simple demonstration of how to use statistical analysis to answer real life questions. 
The app uses t-test and regression analysis to explore the relationship between fuel efficiency and car transmission (automatic or manual).
It explores two questions:
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions


The App is composed by two files:

server.R
ui.R
